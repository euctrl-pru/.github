# Aviation Intelligence Unit (AIU)

Welcome to the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Unit's GitHub page! We are a team of aviation experts dedicated to improving the operational and economic performance of the aviation industry.

As part of the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, we have access to a wealth of data and expertise that allows us to tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing the aviation sector. Our focus is on using data-driven approaches to analyse flight routes, delays and cancellations, and measure network performance in order to improve overall efficiency in the industry.

On this page, you will find a collection of our open-source projects and tools that we have developed to support our mission. These include data analysis and visualization tools, software solutions, and other resources that are designed to help us better understand and address the complex challenges facing the aviation industry.

Whether you are an aviation professional, a data scientist, or simply someone who is interested in the field, we hope that you will find our projects and tools useful and informative. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community, so please feel free to explore and get involved!
